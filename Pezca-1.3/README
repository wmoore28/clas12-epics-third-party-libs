Pezca, the Perl-ezca module.

license:
--------
The software license is documented in the file LICENSE. 

compiling the module (an EPICS base and ezca must be installed):
----------------------------------------------------------------

You should have set EPICS_BASE to the location of your EPICS base and
EPICS_EXTENSIONS to the location where ezca is installed. Alternatively you may
edit file "platform.pm". 

Enter:

"perl Makefile.PL"
"make"


testing:
--------
"make test"
The test-program asks for the name of a process variable and makes a 
read-access to that variable.

installing:
-----------
"make install"

documentation:
--------------
There is a man-page in the man-directory. In the examples directory there 
are 2 examples of a perl ca-gateway (the client reads the data via a 
raw socket connection).

create html documentation with:
"./make_html.sh"

Support of other platforms:
---------------------------
Currently supported are HP-UX, Solaris, Linux and Windows NT.
For other platforms you have to figure out the defines that the compiler 
call needs (e.g. '-DUNIX') and apply the changes to the file platform.p.

This file uses the perl Config-Module to determine the platform. 

Bugs and Problems:
------------------
For the Windows NT version, only Pezca::GetDouble() is tested. For 
all other platforms, all functions have been tested. 

Suggestions or improvements are welcome !
