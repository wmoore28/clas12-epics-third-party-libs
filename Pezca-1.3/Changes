Revision history for Perl extension Pezca.

0.01  Thu Jul  9 12:06:42 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

(0.02-0.04) Sorry, no change history for these versions

0.05  Thu Mar  2 2000
      The package was cleaned up for distribution. The perl module
      platform.p now contains architecture dependent stuff.
      
0.06  Fri Mar  3 2000
      Support for solaris was added (thanks to 
      Rozelle Wright <rwright@lanl.gov>).
      
      An error in the test program test.pl was removed.

0.07  Mon Mar  6 2000
      Sources from EPICS R3.13.1 were integrated into Pezca.
      The makefile-system was re-written.
      Windows-Support has been partially added but was not tested.
      Note that ca/windows_depen.c needed to be patched:
        #ifdef _WIN32 
	  [the original content of windows_depen.c]
	#endif 
	
0.08  Fri Mar 17 2000
      Monitor functions for the reading of strings have been added. The old
      monitor functions were only usable for the reading of floating point
      numbers. All string functions have an 'S' at the end of their name.

0.09  Mon Apr 4  2000
      * Functions for reading and writing channels with more than one item
        (e.g.  Waveform-Record) have been added (GetList and PutList). 
      * The new GetList-Function
	returns a list, like the old Get function. Since GetList can
	return an arbitrary number of elements, it makes sense to return
	the error code as first, not as last element of that list.
	This is different from the old Get functions, which returned the
	error code as the 2nd element of a 2-element list.
	In order to be consistent, replacements have been written for the 
	existing Get-Functions which also return the error code as first 
	list-element. For backward-compatibility, the functions with 
	the new behaviour have got new names (e.g. GetDouble). The old Get
	Functions can still be used, but should not be used for new
	developments.
      * The new naming convention now adds the internal data-type to the 
	function name, e.g. Pezca::Put() becomes Pezca::PutDouble(). The old
	names however can still be used.
      * Further functions of ezca have been added, like ezcaGetPrecision. 
	ezcaGetStatus will not be added in this version, since it's a bit more
	complicated....
      * Perl-Prototypes have been specified for all implemented functions.

0.10  Wed May 17 2000
	An error in Pezca::AutoErrorMessageOff() was corrected.
	
0.2   Mon Dec 18 2000
	Pezca was ported to the Windows NT platform. The program was not
	thoroughly tested but Pezca::get() works. It was compiled using
	Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and perl 5.6. Perl was compiled from
	the official source, using the same c-compiler. 
	The EPICS-sources were taken from Release R3.13.1.
	
0.3   Thu Jan 31 2002
	Sources from epics 3.13.5 were incorporated, replacing the 
	old epics sources. 

0.3.1 Aug 24  2004
	small bugfixes that fix errors on Linux
	
0.3.2 May 11 2007
	new configuration system. platform_standalone.pm configures
	the standalone-version of Pezca (including all channel-access
	sources), platform.pm configures the "on top" version where Pezca
	uses an already installed epics base and ezca libary. 	

0.3.3 May 14 2007
	new configuration system. platform.pm configures
	the "on top" version of Pezca that uses an already installed 
	epics base and ezca libary. 

0.3.3 Oct 10 2007
	platform.pm:
        ------------
	Bugfix with respect to the windows version. envData.c and
	errSymTbl.c are still needed, even if the files are placed in the
	O.Linux directory.

	Pezca.pm, Pezca.xs:
        -------------------
	Bugfix and changes in GetList(), PutList(), PutListOldCa():
	* the list type now must be one of a fixed list of strings.
	* an unknown list type now produces an error message
	* a stupid bug in PutList was removed ("break" was missing)
	* for-loops where changed from one-lines to two liners. The SvIV or
	ST macros from perl otherwise make problems.

        META.yml:
        ---------
	This (generated) file is needed for modern perl-module
	distributions.

	Pezca.html:
	-----------
	the documentation was updated

0.3.3 Sep 28 2010
        The repository was converted from CVS to mercurial.

	.hgignore, MANIFEST, ezca/.cvsignore:
	-------------------------------------
	Changes due to the repository conversion from CVS to mercurial.

	Some CVS specific files were removed, .hgignore was added.

	LICENSE, Pezca.html, Pezca.pm, Pezca.xs, README, README.ontop:
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	Bessy is now "Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin", several changes due to
	this.

	All places were "Bessy" was mentioned were changed since our
	facility is now "Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f√ºr Materialien und
	Energie GmbH".

	Pezca.html, README, docStyle.css, make_html.sh:
	-----------------------------------------------
	A script was added to create the HTML documentation.

	The old file "Pezca.html" was removed from version control. It can
	now always be re-created by calling "./make_html.sh". The generated
	HTML documentation uses a new css file, "docStyle.css", which was
	added to the repository.

1.1   Sep 28 2010
	Pezca.pm, Pezca.xs:
	-------------------
	Pezca has been raised to version 1.1 and two functions were added.

	* Pezca has (finally) been raised to version 1.1. It had a version
          number far below 1.0 for several years now, but if a program is in
          usage for such a long time without major problems it seems justified
          to change the version to 1.1. 1.0 was skipped since it would then
          appear that is program ist very new and just a first stable version,
          but it has been stable for years now.
	* Two functions, Perror() and GetErrorString() were added, they were
	  needed by some application

	index.rst, make_html.sh:
	------------------------
	The Pezca index.html page can now be generated from index.rst.

	The main html page for the Pezca project is now generated from an
	rst (reStructuredText) file.

	Index.html is created with: ./make_html.sh --index

1.1   Nov 29 2012
	.hgignore:
	----------
	.hgignore was updated.

	Generated Pezca*.tar.gz files are now ignored.

1.2   Nov 30 2012

        .hgignore, MANIFEST, MANIFEST.ontop, META.yml, Makefile.PL,
	Makefile.PL.ontop, README, README.EPICS, README.ontop,
        ca/*, db/*, include/*, libCom/*:
        --------------------------------
	The epics libraries have been removed, building "on top" is now the
	default.

	There is (probably) no need for Pezca to be compiled without an
	installed EPICS base. The files form the "stand onlone" version were
	therefor removed.

	MANIFEST, Makefile.PL:
        ----------------------
	Bugfix: The generated tar.gz file didn't contain all the needed
	files.

	The distribution file created with "make dist" was incomplete and
	contained some superfluous files. This was fixed. Changes applied
	here:

	* Perl modules that are only needed for running Makefile.PL were
	also installed along with Pezca.pm. Now in Makefile.PL option "PM"
	specifies that only Pezca.pm is installed.
	* Ezca files were not included in the created tar.gz distribution
	file. This has been fixed by updating the MANIFEST file.

	Pezca.xs, myutils.pm, platform.pm:
        ----------------------------------
	Support for 64 bit linux was added.

	Thanks to patches from Sergey Stepanov <sstepanov@anl.gov>, Pezca
	now supports 64 bit linux.

	Changes, Pezca.pm:
        ------------------
	The version was changed to 1.2, the "Changes" file was updated.

1.3 Mar 24 2014

        Pezca.xs:
        ---------

        Some bugfixes for the windows platform contributed by Sergey Stepanov
        <sstepanov@anl.gov> were included.

        Support for the ezca version 20070625 and older was readded.

        Compiler warnings were removed.

	Changes, Pezca.pm:
        ------------------
	The version was changed to 1.3, the "Changes" file was updated.
