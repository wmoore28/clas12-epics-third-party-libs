=================================
HDF5 & SZIP
=================================
synApps_5_8+ and areaDetector-R2-0+ now require a seperate build for HDF5 and 
SZIP.  Here's what was done on RHEL7 to build the associated 32-bit and 64-bit 
libraries:

  # install packages
  yum install libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel
    
  # for HDF5 & SZIP
  Inside each of these our build script (build_all.sh).  This script will 
  compile and install the associated 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.  The relevant 
  paths after the build will be:
	<packagename>/x86/include
	<packagename>/x86/lib
	<packagename>/x86_64/include
	<packagename>/x86_64/lib

  These paths will need to be set in:
	<areaDetector>/configure/CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86
	<areaDetector>/configure/CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86_64
	
More details can be found in the READMEs for areaDetector.
