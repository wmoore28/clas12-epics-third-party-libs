    Creation of smixx_new tree before it's installation into CVS
    ------------------------------------------------------------
       6-Apr-2001  -->  16-May-2001  (Boda Franek)


  6-Apr-2001

  - Preprocessor source files and the makefile copied from
    ../smixx/preprocessor
    Source files compared with VMS and are identical

  - the source is also identical with that at slac  in
 
   .../package/smixx/v6.6/preprocessor/source

  - New directory "common_source" created. The aim is to migrate the 
    common source in utilities and utilitiesxx into this directory.

  - files used by preprocessor  .../smixx/utilities were copied to 
                                   /smixx_new/common_source

  - checked that they are identical to those at slac in v6.6  and also on vms.
    Only difference on vms was typedefs.hh but the one on vms is obsolete
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 10-Apr-2001  All the files in precessor/source  and common_source  renamed
               cc->cxx and hh->hxx , makefiles changed accordingly and 
              tested...giving the same results.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11-Apr-2001  The next question is, why could not preprocessor be using
              the corresponding files in .../smixx/utilitiesxx/source . 
              These in principle are just renamed files (cc->cxx hh->hxx)
              for PC. If any differences, then the ones in utilitiesxx should
              be more uptodate:

          Comparison brings the following result:

             - name.cxx, name.hxx, nmdptnr.cxx, nmdptnr.hxx  and
               nmdptnrvector.hxx are identical

             - nmdptnrvector.cxx different. The one in utilitiesxx had a bug
               in method append corrected .... take the one from utilitiesxx

             - registrar.cxx & registrar.hxx different. The one in utilitiesxx
               has an extra method (addRegardless).... take it

             - utilities.cxx & utilities.hxx are very different. The ones in
               utilitiesxx has basicaly a lot of extra methods used in
               CXXTranslator...take it

             - The remaining files which are only in utilitiesxx/source can
               now be safely brought over as they are only used by
               CXXTranslator. These are: namevector.hxx & cxx
               smlline.cxx&hxx  smllinevector.cxx&hxx

    If preprocessor works, then merging of utilities&utilitiesxx was achieved!

   It produces indentical results on the files in SMLCode directory
    ...this is probably enough for now
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12-April-2001 h:\SMI directory at RAL franek's directory was copied to 
              /afs.cern.ch/lhcb/online/control/PCatRAL directory.
              It contains the master source for:
              utilitiesxx (.../PCatRAL/utilities/sourceForDevStudio) and
              CXXTranslator (.../PCatRAL/CXXTranslator/sourceForDevStudio)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-April-2001 directory common_source compared with the Master for utilitiesxx (see above)
              Differences are as follows:

      namevector.cxx ... the one in common_source has a bug in 
                         method append fixed
      smllinevector.cxx ... as above
      typedefs.hxx ... the one in common_source is better
      utilities.cxx ... the one in .../PCatRAL/utilities/sourceForDevStudio
                       is more developed all changes are relevant to
                       CXXTranslator
                       This is therefore taken and copied to common_source
      readme.txt from  .../PCatRAL/utilities/sourceForDevStudio copied to
                       common_source

   - created directories
        /afs/cern.ch/lhcb/online/control/smixx_new/cxxtranslator/source
     and copied over the master source in
     .../PCatRAL/CXXTranslator/sourceForDevStudio
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
18-April-2001 
     gmade translator on HP and it does not work!!!

     gmade translator on Linux and it produces identical results for all files
          in .../PCatRAL/SMLcode
----------------------------------------------------------------------------		    
23-April-2001  cxxtranslator/makefile and preprocessor/makefile modified:
               object files from common_source are put into the same directory
	       as the main body....common_source now only has the source and
	       not object directories.

      - state_manager & state_manager/source copied from ../smixx
          the source was then compared with that in $BFROOT at SLAC and
	   only one difference found in logic_engine.cc (pause replaced
	   by dim_wait)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
25-April-2001  rtl & rtl/source  copied from ../smixx

          - *.cc and *.hh renamed to *.cxx and *.hxx,  necessary mods made
	    to point to .hxx files and the makefile modified accordingly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8-May-2001

    - gui, generator, and xgui tree copied from smixx to smixx_new

    - 'cxxtranslator' directory renamed to translator

    - all binary directories deleted

    - new file makeDir  creates a binary directory if it does not exists

    - makefile modified: makeDir is called everytime before gmake
      The main reason for this is because we do not want to put
      the binary directories into CVS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15-May-2001

   The directory tree was restructured to conform to a standard LHCb apperance
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   - new directory 'smixx' created and all the externally visible header
     files copied into it. These are the rtl header files and 
     smixx_version.h file (renamed to version.h)
     
   - new directory 'src' created and the source from source directories
     copied into it. For example  preprocessor/source --> src/preprocessor
     
   - makefiles were copied to the top level
        (e.g preprocessor/makefile --> makefile_preprocessor)
	and tidied up (such as using only ODIR)

   - making bin directory put into .setup file and makeDir file removed
   
   - src/state_manager renamed to src/stateManager and
     src/common_source renamed to src/commonSource
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
16-May-2001
   Finally in CVS and tagged v7. It was checked by checking it out and comparing
   with smixx_new
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-May-2001
   Small changes in stateManager preprocessor & translator  ... 
   see individual History files.
   
==========================   v7r1   ===========================================
   --> 11 June 2001
   Implementing Object Sets. see History files in translator & commonSource
   Translator is now capable to translate them.
==========================  Jun11-2001  ======================================

  --> 13 June 2001
    Object Sets instantiated in State Manager see History in commonSource
    and stateManager
=========================  Jun13-2001  ======================================

 14 June 2001  unistd.h include file not used on Windows NT. Affected:
              preprocessor  stateManager and translator
=========================  Jun14-2001  ======================================

 15-16-17 June 2001 Implemented usage of Object sets in do instruction
                   and insert/remove instruction.
=========================  Jun17-2001 =======================================
 18-19 June 2001 Implemenmted usage of Object Sets in if and when. 
=========================  Jun19-2001 =======================================
 19-20 June 2001 insert and remove instruction can handle object names
                 taken from action parameter
=========================  Jun21-2001 ======================================
  2 July 2001  Insert and Remove instruction are treated as an instruction
               on its own.  See commonSource and translator. At the moment
               still translated into do instruction to keep compatibility
               with the state manager
=========================  Jul02-2001  ===================================
 3-5 July 2001 Treatment of insert/remove instruction completely 
               redesigned. 
                  Until now, it was translated into &INSERT/&REMOVE action.
               The idea behind this was, that this way, execution of whens
               will be automatically triggered by inserting/removing
               objects from sets. This however had some undesirable behaviour
               in cases when several objects were inserted (removed) in/(from)
               a set during an execution of one action.
                  This philosophy is now changed:
               insert/remove instructions are executed immediately, i.e have
               immediate effect. They will however schedule an additional when
               execution that will take place immediatelly after the current
               action (containing insert/remove) is either finished or
               suspended. For the details of the changes, see History file of
               stateManager
================================  Jul05-2001  =================================
12-13 July 2001 Proper treatment of empty Object Sets implemented. For details
             see History file of stateManager
===============================  Jul13-2001  ==================================
20 July 2001 trivial bug but with large consequences fixed in State Manager
================================ Jul20-2001 ===================================
21-24 July 2001

   Object sets are now properly (I hope) treated in If conditions. The secret
  is that when If has to be suspended, then transiting sets are 'frozen'
  so that even when their contents changes, the original will be used when
  if execution is resumed. This can be now released in production.
===============================  v8 ==========================================
23-August-2001
  Bug fixed in State Manager
===============================  v8r1 =========================================
 The version of smixx has been so far incompatible with the version of dim
 in CVS....going to make it compatible:
  
  - references to .hh files in dim changed to .hxx files referenced 
  
  - include files are now in $DIMDIR/dim this affects a few makefiles
..............................................................................
24-August-2001

  utilities.hxx&cxx in stateManager now taken from commonSource. This makes
  it easier to build it on a PC
smixx should now be compatible with the latest CVS dim
===============================  v9  =========================================  

Calculation of server objects and server object sets lists added. see
stateManager and commonSource History files
=============================== v9-srvLists ==================================

31-Jan-2002 

  - Modifications for Solaris 8 (Clara Gaspar):
    New GUI without UIL files (merged GUI and XGUI directories)
    Modifications in the makefiles for the GUI
    Some include files added
    
  - Unlimited number of instructions allowed by using dynamical
    allocation (Boda Franek)
    see state manager History file. Effect was tested on the current ALICE

===============================  v10 =========================================      
  7 February 2002 (Boda Franek)
  
    Removed unnecessary diagnostic prints from State Manager...this reduced
    the size of the current size of ALICE State Manager logfile by factor 12
    
===============================  V10r1 =======================================
  7 May 2002 (Clara Gaspar)

    Fixed RTL: removed solaris 8 warnings and a few bugs in the C++ version.
	Added the "in_state" and "executing" prints in the C++ version.
    Updated generator.c (smiGen) to the new .cxx and .hxx format
    Fixed some bugs in smiGUI and in makefile_gui
    Changed version.h to 1002 (v10r2)

===============================  V10r2 =======================================
  3-4 July 2002 (Boda Franek)

    translator   (see the History file)
    -----------
       Diferent types of Simple Condition are now inheriting from abstract class
       SmpCond. At the moment there are only 2 types:
         1) ('object' in_state 'state')   and
         2) (any_in 'object set' in_state 'state') 

  10 July 2002 (Boda Framek)

    commonSource (see History file)
    -------------
       including missing typedefs

    some improvements to .setup   this is mainly to allow to set one's own ODIR

  11 July 2002 (Boda Franek)

    -  New subdirectory src/utilities
       --------------------------
         - programs which have been used at SLAC and are of general use were
           copied here from slac .../smixx/v6.6.6/utilities

         - references to .hh files changed to .hxx

    -  new makefile_utilities

    - global  makefile updated to include the above

    1 August 2002 (Boda Franek)
    
      minor change to commonSource/utilities.cxx (see the History file)
      
=============================== v11 ========================================== 
  -> 6 February 2003 (Boda Franek)
  
     - new instruction 'endInState state-name'
     
     - when extension using 'endInState'
     
     - new instruction 'removeAll from set-name'
=============================== v12 ==========================================
   18 March 2003 (Boda Franek & Clara Gaspar )
   
      Publishing Object Sets
      
   20 March 2003 (Clara Gaspar)
   
      Bug fixed in RTL      
=============================== v13 ===========================================
    1 May 2003 (Boda Franek)
    
      'remove_all' is now synonym with 'removeall'      also
       'move_to' is synonum with 'endinstate'
       
       see commonSource  & translator
=============================== v13r1 ==========================================
   13 May 2003 (Boda Franek)
   
    The latest version at Slac (v11s2-...) was compared to v11 to find out what
    changes were made to it at Slac. There was a change in commhandler.cxx
    (usleep -> my_sleep) but this is already incorporated in cvs.
    Then there was a minor change to makefile_rtl, makefile_stateManager,
    and makefile_utilities. This was adding -xs to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS on
    Solaris which enables using dbx without object files. These changes
    were incorporated.
=============================== v13r2 ========================================= 
   17 July 2003 (Boda Franek)
   
    State Manager : SmpCond class cleaning...see the History file
                    commited and tagged Jul17-2003

   27 July 2003 (Clara Gaspar)

    SMIUIRTL : smiui_connect_domain() sometimes returned the wrong number of
               objects (0), fixed.
    SMIGUI   : The smiGUI only accepted 512 objects in a domain, 
               increased to 1024
  
   27 July 2003 (Boda Franek)
     State Manager : Further cleaning of SmpCond class... see History file
     
================================ v14 ==========================================
   01 August 2003 (Boda Franek)
   
   - translator  ... new sobj format for Simple condition
   
   - commonSource/namevector.cxx  .... (dynamical increment)   

   - stateManager  ....a) new sobj format for simple condition
                       b) using the modified NameVector class

   - utilities ... #include <iostream.h>
   
   - smixx/version.h   set to 1500
================================= v15 =========================================
   04 August 2003 (Clara Gaspar)
   
   - (Clara Gaspar) bug fix in src/rtl/smiuirtl.c   this is
                      a temporary bodge ******
		      
   - (Boda Franek) minor mods to .setup. Most important: .setup must be
                   ran in smixx package directory
		   
   - smixx/version.h   set to 1501
================================= v15r1 ====================================== 

 05 August 2003 (Boda Franek)
       Speeding things up
       ------------------
     Using the profiling flags (-pg) and analysing with gprof.
     SML used : ~franek/public/smixx/tests/Speed/DemoDet1_domain.sml
     
    a) Program run for 6mins 18secs real tim
       Sampling time was 43.44 secs.
       Out of that 28.65 secs was spent in ObjectRegistrar::gimePointer()
       
    - objectregistrar.cxx modified (not instantiating temp name inside the loop)
    
    b) Program run for 1 min 55 secs real time
       Sampling time was 25.46 secs
       Out of that 12.82 spent in operator==(Name const &, Name const &)
       
    - name.cxx modified ... some redundant code taken out of == method
    
    c) Program run for 2mins 26 secos
       Sampling time was 22:09 ... worth saving but not big deal
       8.42 secs (38%) is still taken by ObjectRegistrar::gimePointer()
=================================== v15r2 ====================================
 ->16 August 2003 (Boda Franek)
 
    commonSource:  new class added 'NmdPtnrList'
    
    stateManager : a) SMIObjectSet class  keeps not only list of object names
                   but also their pointers using the NmdPtnrList class

                   b) SmpCond class when evaluating simple condition does not
		      have to retrieve object pointers from Object Registrar
		      because SMIObjectSet supplies them directly.
	
==================================== v15r3 ====================================
 The speed was tested with the same program as above :
 
      Program run for   25 secs
       Sampling time was 2.28 secs
..............................................................................
  27 October 2003 (Boda Franek)
  
    utilities:  due to the new compiler, #include <iostream.h> added
    
    src/utilities: improved diagnostics
    
    src/stateManager: small changes to SmpCond class
    
    src/translator : improved diagnostics and a small bug fixed
================================= v16 =========================================

  08 November 2003 (Boda Franek)
  
    src/commonSource : new method in NameVector class
    
    src/stateManager : mainly more changes to SmpCond class
    
=================================  v17  =====================================

  14 November 2003 (Boda Franek)
  
    - makefile_stateManager : added option '-O0' to CXXFLAGS to suppress
                             optimization completely

    - src/stateManager : mainly changes to SmpCond class. This now ready
                    for major developments i.e. new types of simple condition

=================================  v18  ======================================	
   
   20 November 2003 (Boda Franek)
   
    - src/commonSource : speeding things up a bit...in the end it did not
                        seem to make much difference
	
    -src/stateManager : same as above	
================================  v18r1 ======================================	
   
   15 December 2003 (Clara Gaspar)
   
    - src/rtl : Made smirtl and smiuirtl dynamic, got rid of parameters.h
	
    - src/stateManager : commhandler.cxx
			 tested for action: &END_IN_STATE_WHEN
			 ! got rid of usleep !!!!

    - smixx include: version.h - set SMIXX_VERSION to 1802 (for 18.2)

    - smixx top level: 
	changed .setup:
		- first checks if in the smixx directory, if yes sets SMIDIR
		- otherwise if SMIDIR defined, ok, leave it as is.
		- otherwise setup fails
	This allows running .setup in a diferent directory if SMIDIR defined.
	changed makefile_rtl:
		User can choose if smirtl and smiuirtl are SHAEREABLE or not
		for Linux only. Default is SHAREABLE.
	In order to make smixx for Linux RedHat 7.3 gcc 3.2:
		gmake FLAGS=-Wno-deprecated [SHAEREABLE=no] all 
================================  v18r2 ======================================	
 24 March 2004 (Boda Franek)

    - smi Preprocessor is working on Windows

    - minor improvement to common source

    - intitial work on the translator to recognise Type 3 simple instruction

=================================  v19 =======================================
 25 March 2004 (Boda Franek)
 
     - Added Visual directory with all the Project files
     
     - little bug corrected in preprocessor

 26 March 2004 (Clara Gaspar)

     -  ctime -> ctime_r   in src/rtl
     -  permitted size of name increased to 65   in state_manager
     -  ctime -> ctime_r in src/state_manager/commhandler.cxx
     
 26 March 2004 (Boda Franek)
 
     - ctime - ctime_r  in state_manager/ut_sm.cxx
     
     - new (common & simpler) version of version.hxx in state_manager
       and preprocessor    

 29 March 2004 (Boda Franek)
 
    New script  'taggingProcedure'  to be run just before tagging. It
    will make sure, that all version and History files are properly updated
 
 31 March 2004 (Boda Franek)
 
   - translator : 1) capitalisation of Object Set names
                  2) allowing empty names in object set initialisation
		  
   - preprocessor : allowing (ignoring)   .repeat 'macro-name'()
   
=== 02-April-2004:12:21 ==========  v20  =================

 24-26 May 2004 (Boda Franek)
 
    State Manager
    -------------
    Round of changes aiming at removing char declarations of names. Starting
    with object names. It has resulted in some tydiing up to do with passing

    1) Propagating 'busy' state through State Managers
    Let's have an  associated object PROXY in domain A. This object could be
    declared in domain B as A::PROXY / associated. If object A goes to 'busy'
    either spontaneously or because A sent it a command, the 'busy' will now
    be passed also to B and 'busy' subsequently broadcasted by B. This is
    particularly usefull for GUIs.
     
    2) Allowing associated objects to go into a state that was not declared

    21-November-2010  (Clara Gaspar)
 
     updated Visual/state_manager.vcproj  and translator.vcproj


======24-November-2010=====  Beginning of the  SVN era  === v4300 ============

    
    25-November-2010 (Clara Gaspar)
    
    removed /smixx/trunk/src/EXAMPLES       r4306
    
    NB (Boda Franek):
      There were 3 directories in CVS which I was not aware of:
      
      src/examples,  src/EXAMPLES  and src/xgui
      
      This is because they were put into repository after my innitial
      checkout. In this case to get them into the working directory
      one has to do 'cvs update -dA'. I has been doing only 'cvs update -A'
      
     01-December-2010  (Clara Gaspar)
   
   - most of the files were added property 'svn:eol-style' of value 'native'  
     
     NB (Boda Franek):
     As some files were by mistake checked into CVS with CRLF EOL, then after
     the property addition they will show differences on every line when
     checked out on linux. The following files are thus affected:
     
   Visual/getDomains.dsp, Visual/domainExists.dsp, Visual/generator.dsp
   Visual/monObjects.dsp, Visual/getdomainobjects.dsp,Visual/tellMonObjects.dsp
   
      In addition, there are 2 files,
              src/preprocessor/cpreproc.cxx
