 9-May-2000 compared the source with that on VMS to make sure it is the same
            and softwarerot has not taken place

 6-April-2001  The same excercise as above and it is identical....this is now
            becomming the master

 9-April-2001  All .hh files renamed to .hxx   All .cc files renamed to cxx and also
              modified to point to .hxx rather than .hh

 10-April-2001  After common files were renamed, #include lines had to be changed
                accordingly

   tested and giving the same results as before 6-April-2001
