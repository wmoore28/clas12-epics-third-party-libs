  9-Apr-2001 The following files were copied from smixx/utilities directory
             because they are used by preprocessor:

             name.cc name.hh nmdptnr.cc nmdptnr.hh nmdptnrvector.cc
             nmdptnrvector.hh registrar.cc registrar.hh utilities.cc
             utilities.hh & typedefs.hh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 10-Apr-2001 Compared with $BFROOT/package/smixx/v6.6 and as expected found
             identical

            .cc & .hh renamed to cxx & hxx  and of course 
            all the #include lines modified
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11-Apr-2001 Files in this directory were compared with 
             ../smixx/utilitiesxx and it looks like the ones which are
             different could be safely taken over.
           The existing ones were first renamed to _old_... (deleted 8 May)

           The remaining files which are only in utilitiesxx/source can now be safely
           brought over as they are only used by CXXTranslator: namevector.hxx & cxx
            smlline.cxx&hxx  smllinevector.cxx&hxx

          The same bug as in nmdptnrvector.cxx in method append found in 
          namevector and smllinevector  and corrected !  This means that
         the template on VMS is wrong. Forget the VMS. When needed,
         use differen templates.
