13-Jul-2001  Combine Set_Name  and  NameList class (they are allmost
            identical) and keep NameList class
	 
19-May-2006 The dimension of the input record (MAXRECL) should be dynamized

19-May-2006  initiator to be re-designed
	NB: 26-Jun-2008  In particular the constructors for SMIObject,
	    SMIClass and SMIObjectSet classes should accept directly NameVector,
	    so that the redundant copying of pObjectCode to lines can be avoided

 1-June-2006 extend &val_of concept in particular to 'if'. Also in addition to
             &val_of,   $name should be used

 1-June-2006 Objects with variable states
 
 1-June-2006 State manager should always check for object existence before
             blindly using 'null' pointer.
	    
 1-June-2006 !check: Is there a limit on parameter values? In particular, can
             DIM handle this?

26-June-2008 urgent! Fix the memory leak in all lists in commonSource...see
             the fix in nmdptnrlist.cxx

15-July-2008 Rewrite smiobject.cxx In particularly subobjects should be
             eradicated 

21-July-2008 when remote object goes spontaneously busy, it should be reported
             by DIM to State Manager.
	     
21-July-2008  Translator! condition.cxx could do with going over. In particular
              stack is fixed size (1000) and not even checks on it.

25-Sep-2008  completely re-design the IF handling

25-Sep-2008   There is still limit 100 on simple conditions...see Condition
              class
	     
25-Sep-2008   pointer to objects should be used instead of name everywhere that
              is possible
	      
	      
15-Jul-2011  pointers to suspended instruction should be reset to zero when
             object resumes execution.
