HDF5 & SZIP
==============================
synApps_5_8+ and areaDetector-R2-0+ now require a seperate build for HDF5 and 
SZIP.  More details can be found in the READMEs for areaDetector.  Here's what 
was done on RHEL7 to build the associated 32-bit and 64-bit libraries:

  # TIFF and JPEG packages
  yum install libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel
    
  # HDF5 and SZIP
  Inside each of these our build script (build_all.sh).  This script will 
  compile and install the associated 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.  Note that 
  HDF5 takes awhile to build and check.  The relevant paths after the build 
  will be:
	<package>/x86/include
	<package>/x86/lib
	<package>/x86_64/include
	<package>/x86_64/lib

  These paths will need to be set in:
	<areaDetector>/configure/CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86
	<areaDetector>/configure/CONFIG_SITE.local.linux-x86_64
